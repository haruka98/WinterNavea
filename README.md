### What is this?
The files are made for the game Aura Kingdom, they allow you to change the look of the Navea map to a more winter suited version.

### How can i use it?
There are two folders, one for the winter version and one for the normal version. This means that you don't have to create a backup, just replace all files with the normal version and you are back to the normal Navea.

To start you simply have to copy all the files from the winter_version folder to your game client. If you've done it correctly you should get a message asking you if you want to replace files. Click on yes and start your client, you're done!
